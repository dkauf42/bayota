# Conducting optimization studies from this bin directory

***Note*** *This readme does not describe how to set up, install, or uninstall the BayOTA packages.\
For those instructions, please see the project-level guide: `bayota/README.md`*


This README documents how to conduct optimization studies using the BayOTA packages.

# üìÅ Bin Structure

In this bin directory, you will find:

* Scripts (shell scripts, jupyter notebooks, python scripts)
* Config files that specify optimization study parameters

# ‚ñ∂ Usage

Optimization studies can be conducted in BayOTA in multiple ways:
1) Command-line: batch mode or single run
2) Python prompt: batch or single run
3) Jupyter notebook: batch or single run

#### ‚å®Ô∏è Command Line Interface

First, customize a specification file as desired in `./bin/specification_files`

Then, execute...
###### Step 0 - A batch of studies
`>> ./bin/run_scripts/run_step0_batch_of_studies.py -n lancasterPA_noReduction --no_slurm`


*Note*: `--no_slurm` argument is used when not running studies in parallel üîÄ, e.g. on a laptop

This will trigger a cascade of four more steps (scripts):
1) single study
2) generate model
3) conduct experiment 
4) solve a trial

#### üêç From the python prompt

    >>> from efficiencysubproblem.src.study import Study

    # Create a model instance
    >>> s = Study(objectivetype='costmin', geoscale='county', geoentities=['Adams, PA'])

    # Solve the instance and get results
    >>> solveroutpath, csvpath, df, objective, feasible = s.go(constraint=5)

#### üìì From a jupyter notebook
The approach to use in a notebook is the same as the python prompt.\
Some example notebooks are provided in the bin/ directory.

They try to follow the guidance of http://pbpython.com/notebook-process.html:

- "A good name for the notebook (as described above)
- A summary header that describes the project
- Free form description of the business reason for this notebook. I like to include names, dates and snippets of emails to make sure I remember the context.
- A list of peoscple/systems where the data originated.
- I include a simple change log. I find it helpful to record when I started and any major changes along the way. I do not update it with every single change but having some date history is very beneficial."

# üêõ Troubleshooting & debugging

* (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED) Use `--verbose` to output commands that bayota executes.
* (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED) Use `--debug` to output configuration and additional (error) logs.
