# BayOTA

BayOTA (Bay Optimization Tools for Analysis) is designed for use by the partners of the
Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) as well as the general public as part of the Optimization Tool
Development Project (EPA-R3-CBP-16-03).
Specifically, this extends the functionality of -
and helps users of - CAST (the Chesapeake Bay Assessement Scenario Tool),
which is the CBP Phase 6 time-averaged watershed model.

# ‚öô How do I get set up?

#### 1üìâ Ensure the IPOPT solver is installed and in $PATH

-- The Ipopt solver must be compiled/installed separately in order to solve Efficiency BMP optimization problems.
- Instructions can be found at https://www.coin-or.org/Ipopt/documentation/node14.html
- After installation, the Ipopt executable location must be added to the environment $PATH variable


#### 2üë• Clone the repository

-- Check out a clone of this repository to a location of your choice, e.g.
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/daka42/bayota.git ~/bayota
```

-- From the project directory, get the latest version:

```
cd bayota/

git pull
```

#### 3üè° Configure before installing

***Note:*** *Important filepaths are set (during install) by the `bayota_settings` package.\
These paths include general output, logging, temporary files, etc., and are defined in the following three config files:*

- `bash_config.con` *specifies the path of the project directory.*
- `logging_config.yaml` *specifies the format and targets of log messages.*
- `user_config.ini` *specifies output path stems (for stdout, graphics, and logs)*

*These three config files are required for conducting BayOTA optimization studies, and will be copied into `~/bayota_ws_{version}/config/` during the first install (or first test run).*

*These files will not be programmatically changed by subsequent code executions after being generated.*\
*The example/default config files can be found in the `bayota_settings` package.*

-- Customize the following values in `bayota_settings/install_config.ini`:
- `project_home`
- `repo_top`


#### 4üíæ Install packages

-- From the project dir (`bayota/`), enter:

```
pip install .
```


#### 5üõ£Ô∏è Double check the local paths

During the first install (or first test run), default configuration files are generated.\
-- In `bayota_ws_{version}/config/`, customize values within:

- `user_config.ini` to direct output to the desired directories.\
- `bash_config.con` to specify the project home.


#### 6‚úÖ Test the installation

-- From the project directory, run the automated test suites:

***(Note, these are currently out-of-sync with the packages, so will fail)***

```
cd bayota/

python castjeeves/setup.py test

python efficiencysubproblem/setup.py test
```

***Note:*** *Tests can be run from the project directory (`bayota/`) even though they are located within each package.\
If you try to run `python setup.py test` from the project dir directly, you will get an error message like:\
"no tests specified at the top(bayota package)-level".*

***Note:*** *To remove the test files after running the tests, use `python setup.py clean`.*

-- **If the tests pass, you should be good to go!**

# ‚ñ∂ Usage

Optimization studies can be conducted in BayOTA in multiple ways:
1) Command-line: batch mode or single run
2) Python prompt: batch or single run
3) Jupyter notebook: batch or single run

#### Specification Files
Typical usage requires setting up model and run configurations in 'specification files'. 
These are defined in `bayota/bin/specification_files/`, and there are 3 types:
* **batch specs** - These set up one or more studies, by specifying:
    - geographies
    - names of model and experiment spec files to use
    - other options, such as moving/translating solution files after solving
* **model specs** - These set up the model objectives/constraints
* **experiment specs** - These allow modification of the model for particular experiments and running through different values of constraints.

#### 1‚å® From the command line
-- First, change directory to the project root (`cd bayota/`).

Five 'run' scripts are provided.  They provide the ability to run a batch of optimization studies automatically, \
or with individual steps run separately. They are, in order of their automated execution during a batch submission:
1) `run_step0_batch_of_studies.py`
2) `run_step1_single_study.py`
3) `run_step2_generatemodel.py`
4) `run_step3_conductexperiment.py`
5) `run_step4_solveonetrial.py`

###### Batch runs are set up using 'specification files'. These can be found in `bayota/bin/specification_files`.

-- Example command for a batch of studies:
* `-d` (or `--dryrun`) argument can be included to only print the commands that would be submitted without running them
* `--no_slurm` argument needed when not using the SLURM job manager
* `--help` for command syntax

```
./bin/run_scripts/run_step0_batch_of_studies.py -n calvertMD_cost_and_load_objective_experiments.yaml --dryrun
```


#### 2üêç From the python prompt
```python
from efficiencysubproblem.src.model_handling import model_generator
from efficiencysubproblem.src.solver_handling import solvehandler

# Create a model instance
model_spec_file = '/bayota/bin/specification_files/model_specs/costmin_total_Npercentreduction.yaml'
mdlhandler = model_generator.ModelHandlerBase(model_spec_file=model_spec_file,
                                              geoscale='county',
                                              geoentities='Perry, PA',
                                              savedata2file=False,
                                              baseloadingfilename='2010NoActionLoads_20190325.csv',
                                              log_level='INFO')
mdl = mdlhandler.model

# Set a constraint level
mdl.percent_reduction_minimum['N'] = 20

# Solve the instance and get results
solution_dict = solvehandler.basic_solve(modelhandler=mdlhandler, mdl=mdlhandler.model,
                                         translate_to_cast_format='True')
                                             
print("solving timestamp: %s      feasible: %s" %
      (solution_dict['timestamp'], solution_dict['feasible']))

solution_data_frame = solution_dict['solution_df']
```

#### 3üìì From a jupyter notebook
The approach to use in a notebook is the same as the python prompt.\
Some example notebooks are provided in the bin/jnotebooks/ directory.

### üßπ Cleaning up after intallation and runs

--- To remove build files created by "`python setup.py install`" or to remove temporary files created in the project home during a run:

```
python setup.py clean
```

# üöÆ Uninstall

--- To uninstall the python packages from your environment (site-packages):

```
pip uninstall bayota
```

--- *(less common) To remove development version of package (i.e., remove it from easy-install.pth and delete the .egg-link)*

```
python setup.py develop --uninstall
```

--- To remove everything (uninstall the python packages and then delete the source directory):

```
pip uninstall bayota
rm -r bayota/
```

# üìî Other Notes

To use pynumero package from Pyomo:
- `scipy` is required
- may need to run `conda install -c conda-forge pynumero_libraries` for ASL library

# üêõ Debugging or troubleshooting

* Use `--log_level=DEBUG` to output the most verbose logging messages.
